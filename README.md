# fitness-tracker
Using mobile sensor data from the matlab mobile, the best model is build to by training and testing data. The model is used to track the activity of the person and distance travelled by them.
Install MATLAB Mobile app from playstore for collecting data and send them over cloud.
Make sure you have the MATLAB Connector installed in the PC for building the model.
The files SittingAcc.mat, walking_acc.mat, driving_acc.mat are the sample data collected to train the model in the MATLAB. The testing_acc is the data used to test the trained model and to choose the best one among them. ProjectModel.mat file holds the data to find the distance travelled by the person totally from starting.
The ProjectMatlab.mlx hold the main code to train, test and build the model using MATLAB.
Happy Learning!.
